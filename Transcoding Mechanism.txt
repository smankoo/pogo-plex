Transcoding Mechanism
=====================
All downloaded videos must be transferred to transcode-out directory

At Pogo-Plex
1. Look for transcoding-host (w.o.l. if required)
2. *when transcoding-host found* - transfer videos to transcoding-host (scp/ftp)

At Transcoding-Host
1. Monitor transcode-pending directory. 
2. *when file(s) received - Transcode video - output to transcode-interim directory
3. *after transcode is complete* - move the file from transcode-interim dir to transcode-done

At Pogo-Plex
1. Monitor transcode-done directory on transcoding-host
2. *when file found* - copy to transcode-in dir
3. Transfer contents of transcode-in dir to Movies dir
