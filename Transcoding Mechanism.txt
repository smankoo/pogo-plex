Transcoding Mechanism
=====================
All downloaded videos must be transferred to transcode-out directory

At Pogo-Plex
0. [Continuous Loop] Monitor transcode-out dir, when files found -
	1. Look for transcoding-host (w.o.l. if required) [Loop until done]
	2. *when transcoding-host found* - transfer contents of transcode-out to transcoding-host (scp/ftp)

At Transcoding-Host
1. Monitor transcode-pending directory. *when file(s) received - Move file to transcode-queue dir [Continuous loop every - 2 mins]
2. Transcode videos in transcode-queue dir - output to transcode-interim directory
3. Move the videos from transcode-interim dir to transcode-done - If successful, delete the contents of transcode-queue dir
4. Monitor transcode-done dir [Continuous Loop every - 5 mins]
5. 		*If files found* - 
			- Check if any scp/ftp process is running.
				- If not, copy the contents of transcode-done dir to pogo-plex (scp/ftp) [Loop until done] 
7. Delete the contents of transcode-done dir 

At Pogo-Plex
1. Monitor transcode-done directory on transcoding-host
2. *when file found* - copy to transcode-in dir
3. Transfer contents of transcode-in dir to Movies dir
